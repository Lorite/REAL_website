title: About us

The vision of the REAL lab is to do research on the border between fiction and fact, to create new, feasible solutions for the society of tomorrow. The lab has an interdisciplinary experimental practice and explores what-if scenarios using fundamental science and engineering to work towards realization of these scenarios. Academically, the group is rooted in  artificial intelligence with specific interests in robotics and evolutionary computation, but generally the research agenda is driven by opportunities arising both within science and in society.
