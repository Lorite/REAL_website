I started my industrial PhD early 2018 with Paolo Burelli as my supervisor and Tactile Games as my industrial partner. The topic is automated live game operations with focus on creating tools for automating various processes in the game creation process. This involves predicting player churn as well as creating playtesting agents for estimating and modelling perceived level difficulty in mobile puzzle games.
