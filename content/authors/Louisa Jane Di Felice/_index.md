# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research is driven by quantitative and qualitative approaches grounded in complexity. I am interested in the behaviour of multi-scale systems, particularly in how different scales affect one another through information flows and feedback cycles. Right now, I am thinking about group formation, decision-making and collective computation in multi-scale systems, taking inspiration from human social systems. Previously, I worked on sustainability assessments at the science-policy interface.
