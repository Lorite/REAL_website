I am an assistant professor at the department of Digital Design of the IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark. Before that, I was a senior researcher at Artanim Foundation, a Swiss research center specialized in motion capture technologies. My research interests include virtual and mixed reality, immersive interaction and spatial interfaces, machine learning in HCI and design and computer animation and graphics.
