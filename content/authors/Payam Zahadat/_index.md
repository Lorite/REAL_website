I study how complex collective systems function and design computational methods for distributed artificial systems (e.g., robotic swarms) by taking inspiration from natural systems.  

My research includes both theoretical studies and applications in the field of swarm robotics, modular robotics, collective intelligence, self-organizing systems, evolutionary robotics, and bio-inspired computation.
