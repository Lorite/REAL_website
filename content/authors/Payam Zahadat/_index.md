# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research focuses on swarm robotics and collecive intelligent systems. I am interested in how collective and complex systems function and take inspirations from natural (e.g., biological) systems to design computational methods applicable to distributed artificial systems.

I am an assistant professor at the computer science department of the IT University of Copenahgen, Denmark. Before that, I was a university assistant and postdoc at the University of Graz, Austria, and a research assistant at the Modular Robotics Lab, the Maersk McKinney Moller Institute, University of Southern Denmark. During the last years, I have been part of several EU-funded projects, i.e., florarobotica, ASSISIbf, CoCoRo, SYMBRION and REPLICATOR, and Locomorph. My research interests include both theoretical studies and applications in the field of swarm robotics and multi-modular robotics, collective intelligence, self-organizing systems, evolutionary robotics, and bio-inspired computation.
