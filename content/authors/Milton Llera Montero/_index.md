I am a Computer and Cognitive Scientist working at the intersection between AI and Psychology. My current research focuses on how to use developmental programs that generate agents capable of robust generalisation and lifelong learning. Previosly, I studied the combinatorial generalisation capacity of Deep Learning systems of vision which was the topic of my PhD thesis. I have also worked on human psychopysics using generative systems to model human decision making in naturalistic stimuli, and on credit assignment in bio-inspired recurrent neural networks.
