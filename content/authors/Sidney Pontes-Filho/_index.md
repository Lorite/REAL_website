I am a visiting PhD student under the supervision of Sebastian Risi. The visiting period is from September to December, 2021. My PhD program in Computer Science is at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway, and I am working as a PhD Fellow at Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet), Oslo, Norway. I started my doctoral studies in September, 2018. My current research interests are evolutionary robotics, neuroevolution, meta-learning, complex systems, computational neuroscience, open-endedness and unconventional computing.
