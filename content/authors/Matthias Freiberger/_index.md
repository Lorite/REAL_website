Matthias Freiberger is a researcher focusing on efficient and bio-inspired artificial intelligence. Currently, he holds a position as postdoctoral researcher at the Robotics, Evolution and Art Lab/Creative AI Lab at the IT University of Copenhagen. There he dedicates most of his time to the ArtNet project, exploring novel ways discover fresh perspectives on large collections of classic artworks by means of artificial intelligence. In the past during his PhD and  previous postdoctoral fellowship, he has contributed to research projects on both national and international level, under the overarching theme of efficient and sustainable artificial intelligence.
He obtained a Ph.D. degree in computer science engineering from Ghent University in 2020 as well as Master's degree in Information and Computer Engineering  from Graz University of Technology in 2016.
