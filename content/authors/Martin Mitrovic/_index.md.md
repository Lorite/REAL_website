bio: After earning my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the University of Belgrade, I pursued a Master's degree in Games at the IT University of Copenhagen, which I completed in the summer of 2024. I am currently an Industrial PhD candidate at the IT University of Copenhagen, collaborating with modl.ai. My primary research focus is the application of large language models (LLMs) for quality assurance (QA) in video games. For my Master's thesis, I investigated the potential of LLMs to detect visual bugs in video games. I am continuing to build upon this research during my PhD studies, with the goal of developing AI bots capable of simulating human playtesters.
