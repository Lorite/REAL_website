If I start from the latest status, I am currently working on and studying an Industrial PhD at the IT University of Copenhagen in collaboration with Helix Lab and a multinational Danish corporation. I am working on multi-robot collaboration for industrial applications.

From September 2022 to February 2025, I worked as a robotics software engineer at Mobile Industrial Robots A/S (MiR) in the R&D department. I contributed to the full software development lifecycle of cutting-edge robotics solutions within an international Agile team, specializing in hardware abstraction, embedded, and computer vision. Among other things, I successfully implemented a complex 5-camera 3D vision system, managed cross-compilation from x86_64 to ARM, and refined point cloud processing for enhanced environmental understanding. I designed and implemented C++ and Python software components within a ROS framework, optimized CI/CD pipelines, and played a crucial role in the launch of the MiR1200 Pallet Jack, ensuring robust quality through comprehensive testing. I was also recognized with two internal innovation awards for projects developed during hackathons.

In August 2022, I completed the Master in Advanced Robotics Japan-Europe EMJMD program at Keio University in Japan, after being at Ecole Centrale de Nantes in France. This Master's program was fully funded by the EU. During the 2 years of my master's degree, I worked as a researcher at Ohtsuki laboratory and co-authored 2 journal articles at MDPI Sensors. The research was focused on developing a mobile robot simulator and 2D LiDARs and then training a neural network capable of localizing humans and predicting their activities. 

Previously, I completed a 5-year double bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering + Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering at the University of Deusto in Bilbao, Spain. During my undergraduate years, I worked as an assistant in programming subjects and EU projects related to education. 

My main fields of interest involve projects where I can improve people's lives in the field of robotics. I thrive in environments where I can learn and evolve, both professionally and personally, embracing new challenges as opportunities for growth.
