Morten Roed Frederiksen is a software developer and robotics engineer whose current work centers on agentic large language model (LLM) control architectures for robotics. By combining advanced AI-driven decision-making with user-focused design principles, he aims to develop more adaptive, context-aware robots that can dynamically interpret human input and respond over extended interactions. This approach reflects Morten’s broader commitment to marrying technical innovation with insights from psychology, affective computing, and human-robot interaction (HRI) research.

Beyond these LLM-driven architectures, Morten’s work has long emphasized socially assistive and embodied affective robotics. By integrating reinforcement learning and physiological sensing into social robot engineering and design, Morten seeks to broaden robots’ expressive and empathetic capacities—ultimately enhancing their ability to support individuals coping with anxiety, stress, and related challenges.

Morten holds a PhD in robotics, as well as BA and MA degrees in software development. He has also been awarded several research scholarships, including the Fulbright Scholarship. His ongoing and future projects continue to explore the intersection of robust engineering, affective interaction, and AI-driven personalization—pushing the boundaries of how robots perceive human emotions and adapt their behaviors to promote well-being.
