# Description

Random exploration is one of the main mechanisms through which reinforcement learning (RL) solves tasks. However, random exploration can lead to undesirable or catastrophic outcomes when learning in safety-critical environments. In fact, safe learning is one of the major obstacles towards real-world agents that can learn during deployment.
This project revolves around approaches that automatically train sub-modules that shape learning such that the agent will instinctively avoid dangers while still being capable of exploring its surroundings to learn new tasks.
