# Description


The Evocraft project explores the potential of Minecraft for conceiving and testing [open-ended algorithms](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/open-endedness-the-last-grand-challenge-youve-never-heard-of/). 


As a part of the project we developed the [Evocraft-py](https://github.com/real-itu/Evocraft-py), a python API to interact with Minecraft. We run a yearly competition using the framework with the goal of promoting proliferation of the open-endedness research field.
